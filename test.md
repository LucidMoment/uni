## This is a header one level below.

### And this is the third header.


Would you *like* to write some _curvy_ stuff?

Writing **text** in fat and bold? Using __double Underscores__!

*__Scratch some?__* Use double ~~tildes~~.

### Testing enumeration in this section.

*1Point to consider
*2Another point to consider

### Intendend block testing area.

   Intendend block of text was used **in this case**.
   In general, this stuff is pretty awesome.

   Begin new block here. Next time, i should test/use a kind of a warning message box.

# URLs

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```
