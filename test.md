# This Is A Test Header!

## This is a header one level below.

### And this is the third header.


Would you *like* to write some _curvy_ stuff?

Writing **text** in fat and bold? Using __double Underscores__!

*__Scratch some?__* Use double ~~tildes~~.

¨*Unordered List Item 1
¨*Unordered List Item 2

1. We have another item 1
2. This is another fucking item
..*Sub-List

# URLs

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```
