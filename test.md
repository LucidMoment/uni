# This Is A Test Header!

## This is a header one level below.

### And this is the third header.


Would you *like* to write some _curvy_ stuff?

Writing **text** in fat and bold? Using __double Underscores__!

*__Scratch some?__* Use double ~~tildes~~.

### Testing enumeration in this section.

1. First Point
2. Another item
  * unordered sub-list

### Indented block testing area.
________
1. First ordered item

   Indended block of text was used **in this case**.
   In general, this stuff is pretty awesome.

   Begin new block here. Next time, i should test/use a kind of a warning message box.

# URLs

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
